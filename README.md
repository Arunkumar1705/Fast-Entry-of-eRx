# Fast-Entry-of-eRx


## Business Background: 
This use case is applicable for physicians in all settings (clinics, hospitals, etc).


## AS-IS Scenario:
• Physicians use EMR software to enter all details about the patient. They also enter the medications prescribed, i.e., enter the
prescription
• Entry of a prescription in a software takes much more time than hand written prescription, but data entry in software enables
prescription data to be available to pharmacy and insurance companies, and lends itself to research & analytics.


## TO-BE Scenario:
• The data entry burden of prescriptions should be reduced, and be comparable to that of hand written prescription
Problem Statement:
To be able to enter a prescription with structured data in a software system, within a comparable time to hand written prescription


## Constraints:
• Structured components of a prescription are: Medication Name with RxNORM code, dosage, route, frequency, and additional
instructions
• Medication Name, dosage, and RxNORM code, will be available in an industry standard drug database, which needs to be integrated
into the solution


## Success Criteria:
• User can create a prescription for one drug within 30-45 seconds
